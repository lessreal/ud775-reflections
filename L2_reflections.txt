Lesson 2:

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- Git creates a hidden directory to store the repository, including data on all commits in the project.
- Initializing a repository is necessary because otherwise git will be unable to track any changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- The staging area is a temporary area to hold files with changes that are not yet part of a commit.
- Changes to files in the working directory do not affect files in the staging area until those files are manually added with git add.
- Once a git commit is applied, all files in the staging area become part of a new commit in the repository.
- This approach allows for some experimentation with files in the working directory that you may not necessarily want to add to a commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
- Choosing which files to add to the staging areas ensures that you are committing only the changes you want.
- Being able to check the differences between the staging area and the repository or working directory allows you to examine changes before they are committed.
