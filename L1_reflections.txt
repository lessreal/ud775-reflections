Lesson 1:

How did viewing a diff between two versions help you spot the bug?'
- It highlighted the changes automatically, so I didn't have to maually scroll through the files.
- Because the areas that were changed were only a few lines of code, I only had to focus on a few small sections.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
- New bugs would be easier to track down because I could move back to a point before the bug was introduced and see what changes were made after.
- I would have the security of knowing that a working version of the project could still be accessed while experimenting with new code.
